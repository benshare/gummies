# gummies

My solution to the gummy problem, using DP! To run, just use `python gummies.py`.

By changing the parameters to `getExpectedGummies` you can check out the results for different starting states. Meanwhile, the two graphing methods give visuals for A) what happens as the ratio of favorable (denoted 'black') to unfavorable gummies changes, and B) how the parameters of draw size and individual allotment impact expected results.
